Parser for LSI Storage Command Line Tool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --pd-list        Get status of Physical Drives (default mode)
  --vd-list        Get status of Virtual Drives
  --pd-count       Get number of Physical Drives
  --vd-count       Get number of Virtual Drives
  --missing-count  Get number of Missing(failed) drives
  --sample-config  Show example config for Telegraf
  --file FILE      JSON file to get data from file instead of getting it from
                   controller. Usually you don't need this option

  The tool is simple wrapper around Storage Command Line Tool.
  It is intended to be run by Telegraf `exec` input module
  to collect metrics for Physical Drives (PD) and
  Virtual Drives (VD/RAID arrays) connected to LSI controllers
  known to Storage Command Line Tool (StorCLI). Actually it works
  as simple filter to normalize data it gets from StorCLI.
  It run StorCLI utility to get data from controller.
  The tool looks for StorCLI binary in the following directories:
    current directory
    /opt/MegaRAID/storcli
    $PATH 

  Tested with folowing RAID controllers:
    LSI 3108 MegaRAID
    Cisco 12G SAS Modular Raid Controller
  and
    Storage Command Line Tool Ver 1.03.11 Jan 30, 2013
    Storage Command Line Tool Ver 007.0205.0000.0000 March 27, 2017

  Limitations:
    only one controller is supported at the time
    --sample-config is broken
    must be run via `sudo`
